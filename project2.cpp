/* Workers at a particular company have won a 7.6% pay increase retroactive for 6 months. Write a program that takes an

 * annual salary, and the new monthly salary. Use a variable declaration with the modifier const to express the pay
 * increase. Your program should allow the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes.
